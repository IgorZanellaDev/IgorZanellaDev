# Hello World, I'm [Igor Zanella](https://www.igorzanella.dev) 👋🏻
Hi! I'm Igor Zanella, I'm Italian, and I'm Full Stack Developer, I mostly work on frontend projects and applications using React and Typescript.

## 🚀 Projects I'm currently working on
### 💬 Customerly ([go to customerly.io](https://www.customerly.io))
[Customerly](https://www.customerly.io) is a communication suite. Its core business is customer support with a chat widget for websites.
But it also has marketing automation and customer satisfaction features.
I'm in the startup team as a partner and Full Stack Developer, and I help other people develop the product in all its parts, from frontend to backend and database.
The mission is to support and inspire at least 1 billion people.

### 💻 ComputerPortatile.com ([go to computerportatile.com](https://www.computerportatile.com))
[ComputerPortatile.com](https://www.computerportatile.com) is an Italian website that helps friends who ask me for the best laptop to buy.
I also use it to do some SEO experiments, trying to rank the website high for some keywords.
Other than this, I'm also trying to earn from this, using Amazon Affiliate Program.

### 📝 Other projects
You can find my other projects on [my website](https://www.igorzanella.dev/projects). Some are not live anymore, but the code is still on GitHub.

## 👨🏻‍🏫 My courses
### ⚛️ React, Typescript e Styled Components: da zero a web app! ([go to course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-typescript-e-styled-components-da-zero-a-web-app/?referralCode=36449F31118CB6A9A61C))
This is my first Italian course on Udemy. I created this for people who want to approach React for the first time.
With this course, it's possible to learn the React bases with TypeScript and Styled Components.
Perfect to start developing some web applications. On [my website](https://igorzanella.dev/courses) you can also find a discount for the course.

## 📦 My open source NPM packages
### 📸 ssr-react-insta-stories
This is a forked package. It's forked from react-insta-stories but modified to work with SSR frameworks like Gatsby. Simple fork with some removal and modifications.
