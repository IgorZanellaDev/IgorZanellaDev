# Hello World, I'm [Igor Zanella](https://www.igorzanella.dev) 👋🏻
Hi! I'm Igor Zanella, I'm Italian, and I'm Full Stack Developer, I mostly work on frontend projects and applications using React and Typescript.

## 🚀 Projects I'm currently working on
### 💬 Customerly ([go to customerly.io](https://www.customerly.io))
[Customerly](https://www.customerly.io) is a communication suite. Its core business is customer support with a chat widget for websites.
But it also has marketing automation and customer satisfaction features.
I'm in the startup team as a partner and Full Stack Developer, and I help other people develop the product in all its parts, from frontend to backend and database.
The mission is to support and inspire at least 1 billion people.

### 💻 ComputerPortatile.com ([go to computerportatile.com](https://www.computerportatile.com))
[ComputerPortatile.com](https://www.computerportatile.com) is an Italian website that helps friends who ask me for the best laptop to buy.
